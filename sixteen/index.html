 Okay, so the story of this photo is, it's from this summer. I took it when I was in Salt Lake City, visiting my friend Ella, who I met when I was working at a summer camp a few summers ago. And we always have adventures together. This particular day, I had flown in and I had worked remotely all day and I was coming off of no sleep.

She also has a crazy job. So we're both really sleep deprived, but we're having this crazy day. And at the end of it, she's like, “Doni, we need to go see the sunset. If you miss the sunset, it would be such a bummer. Like, we have to go.” I'm exhausted. We get up and she's like, “we're not gonna make it.” She just starts sprinting up this hill. It’s a path that is a complete straight shot up a mountain, essentially the side of a mountain, or hill, whatever you wanna call it. She just starts running up it. And I'm like, “Ella, like I'm not gonna make it, like I'm falling on my hands and knees.”

At one point, I'm just lying there thinking I'm gonna fall off the side of this hill. I look up, and she's just standing there waving at me from the top. She's just framed perfectly in the middle of these sunflowers. It was just this really magical moment where I was just so happy to be with a friend and be outside and just have dirt on my knees and be laughing.

And then I finally made it up to the top of the hill. But I think that photograph is a really special moment. 

So that's that story.
