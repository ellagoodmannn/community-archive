<h1>Burke, VT</h1>

<p>
This was taken in Burke, Vermont during the summer of 2020. I was on a walk with my family. My family used to take trips to Vermont every winter, but we stopped before I made it to high school, so this was my first time being back in a while. This was also the time when I felt closest to my brother. Most of my 2020 was spent outside with him, and our relationship really grew that year.
