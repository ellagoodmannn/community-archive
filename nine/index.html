â€ŠHi Ella. This is a photo of the first time I was published in print in a newspaper. I had written for my school newspapers before, but this was the first time that I'd gotten an article published in a city newspaper. I was so excited because I had driven up there twice actually, to Edmonds, which is a 30 minute driveway from where I was to try and find the print edition, and I couldn't find it the first time.

Then I drove up a second time with my boyfriend. I finally found it and I was so excited because I was flipping through the newspaper trying to find my article because I didn't know what page it was on. And it turns out it was on the front page! Just that little small section, the city climate meeting article.

I just had the biggest smile because the first time I was published, it was on the front page. And then this started my journey of getting published more often. This is just a milestone moment because it was my dream to have my writing in print in a newspaper that was distributed throughout the city.

It was a very happy moment. Bye Ella. Love you.
