This is my mid-buzz cut, when I decided to get my hair buzzed and I'm currently about 3/4 of the way through my cut. As you can see, it’s kind of a mix of like regret, but also there's a little bit of excitement for how people are gonna react to it and how life is gonna feel going forward. It was definitely a big decision which is not taken lightly by my parents, so I kind of foresaw that and it's reflected in this moment but at the same time, it was a big decision, and it's kinda like a moment of freedom where I just kinda said, “you know what people aren’t gonna like this, but I'm gonna do it anyways.” So it's a mix of those kinds of emotions. Like, a little bit of not regret, not fear, but an anticipation for what's gonna come, but also like excitement.
